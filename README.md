# classification-models
implementatin of knn, decision tree, support vector machine and logistic regression on the same dataset to see which one produces the best result.

This work is the final assignment of an online course called Machine Learning with Python, which is provided by IBM. I used different classification methods to 
check different evaluation accuracies. 

I worked on a loan dataset to predict a binary classification. If a loan taken out by a customer is paidoff or goes to collection. 

Onehot encoding, data standardization, seaborn visualization, data cleansing are implemented thorughout the project. 

Decision tree model among all seems to work best on this specific case with the accuracy scores: jaccard score 0.77 and f1 score:0.72
